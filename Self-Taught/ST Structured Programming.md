# Structured Programming
Structured Programming is a [[Univesp Programming Paradigm]] which allows the use of *control structures* to command the execution of a program.

These control structures allow to execute lines of code in repetition or given that a certain condition is `true` or `false`

Structured programming was created to substitute the constand need of `go to` statements of [[ST Imperative Programming]]

## Control Structures

### Conditionals
```
if (expression)
{
    ...
}
else
{
   ... 
}
```

```
switch (expression)
{
    case constant1:
        ....
        break;

    case constant2:
        ....
        break;
}
```

### Repetition
```
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    ...
}
```

```
while (expression)
{
    ...
}
```

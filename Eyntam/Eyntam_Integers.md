# Integers
- All whole numbers, incluiding negative.  
    - Negative integers are marked with a *minus sign* 
    - Integers **do not** have fractional part or decimals   

*Every integer is a [Rational Number](./Eyntam_Rational-Numbers.md),* but the opposite is not true
## Example
$1$ is an integer, its opposite is $-1$  
$10$ is an integer, its opposite is $-10$  
$42$ is an integer, its opposite is $-42$  
$0$ is neutral, it's neither positive or negative

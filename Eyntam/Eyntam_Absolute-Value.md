# Absolute Value
- The distance of a number from $0$ on a [Number Line](./Eyntam_Number-Line.md)
    - *Always [positive](./Eyntam_Positive-Negative-Numbers.md)* $(+)$
    - Represented with two bars $| |$
        $$|-4| = 4$$

        $$|4| = 4$$
- The bars are equivalent to parenthesis, meaning it has priority during resolution
    $$|5 - 3| = |2| = 2$$

- minus $-$ and plus $+$ signs outside the bars are applied after the bars are solved
    $$- |-16| = -16$$
- A number in front of the bars means multiplication
    $$2 |-4|$ -> $2*4 = 8$$

# Factors
- [Integers](./Eyntam_Integers.md) divisibles of a given number, leaving no remainder
    - Divisibles of $6 = 1, 2, 3, 6$
        - ${6}\div{1} = 6$
        - ${6}\div{2} = 3$
        - ${6}\div{3} = 2$
        - ${6}\div{6} = 1$
    - Factors are also the numbers that result in $6$ in a multiplication
        - $1\cdot 6 = 6$
        - $2\cdot 3 = 6$

## Shortcuts
- **All even integers are divisible by 2**
- **An integer is divisible by 3 if the sum of its integers is divisible by 3**
    - $42$
    - $4+2 = 6$
    - ${6}\div{2} = 3$
- **An integer is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5**

- **An integer is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisble by 9**
    - $297$
    - $2 + 9 + 7 = 18$
    - ${18}\div{9} = 2$
- **An integer is divisible by 10 if it ends in 0**

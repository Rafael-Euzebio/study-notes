# Fractions Conversion
[Mixed](./Eyntam_Mixed-Fractions.md) and [Improper](./Eyntam_Improper-Fractions.md) fractions can be converted between themselves

## Improper to Mixed

- Divide the numerator by the denominator
    - If there's no remainder, than the result is only a whole number
        - $\frac{12}{2} = 6$
    - If there's a remainder, the whole part must be in front of the fraction and the remainder becomes the numerator
        - $\frac{15}{2} = 7\frac{1}{2}$

## Mixed to Improper
- Multiply the whole number at the left by the denominator
    - Add the result to the numerator
        - $7\frac{1}{2} = (7 \cdot 2) + 1 = 14 + 1 = \frac{15}{2}$

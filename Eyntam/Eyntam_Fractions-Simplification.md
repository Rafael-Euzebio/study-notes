# Fractions Simplification

- Simplifying is changing the numerator and denominator to smaller numbers which represent the same fraction
    - $\frac{4}{8}$ means "half", 4 is half of 8, so it's the same as $\frac{1}{2}$
- Find the [GCF](./Eyntam_Greatest-Common-Factor.md) of the numerator and denominator
    - The greates number that both 4 and 8 can be divided by is 4
        $$\frac{4 \div 4}{8 \div 4} = \frac{1}{2}$$
    $$\frac{10 \div 5}{35 \div 5} = \frac{2}{7}$$
    $$\frac{24 \div 12}{128 \div 12} = \frac{2}{9}$$

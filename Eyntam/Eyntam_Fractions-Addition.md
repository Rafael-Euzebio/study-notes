# Fractions Addition

- If two fractions have the same denominator, add the numerators only
    $$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{2}$$
    - **Adding the denominators is a mistake**
        $$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$$
    - If the denominators are different they be converted to the same denominator by finding their [LCM](./Eyntam_Least-Common-Multiple.md)
        - **Addng fractions with different denominators is a mistake. They represent parts of different sizes. They must have equal size to be added together**
        - The numerators must be multiplied by the factor which results in the LCM
        $$\frac{2}{5} + \frac{1}{4}$$
        $$5 \cdot 4 = 20$$
        $$4 \cdot 5 = 20$$
        $$\frac{2 \cdot 4}{5 \cdot 4} + \frac{1 \cdot 5}{4 \cdot 5}$$
        $$\frac{8}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{13}{20}$$

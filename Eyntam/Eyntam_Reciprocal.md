# Reciprocal
- Reciprocal of a number is the number which results in 1 when multiplying both
    - Reciprocal of 2 is 0.5
        $$2 \cdot 0.5 = 1$$
    - It is often represented as a fraction
        $$ 2 \cdot \frac{2}{1} = 1$$
        $$ 0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1$$ 

    - To easily find it you can turn the number into a [Fraction](./Eyntam_Fractions.md) and flip numerator and denominators
        $$ 8 = \frac{1}{8}$$
        $$ \frac{8}{1} = 0.125$$
        $$ 8 \cdot 0.125 = 1$$

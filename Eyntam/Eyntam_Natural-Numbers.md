# Natural Numbers
Natural Numbers are all whole numbers, except *zero*, therefore they are:
- Non Negative
    - With no fractions or decimals
        - $1, 2, 3, 4, 5...$ 

*Every natural number is a [Whole Number](./Eyntam_Whole-Numbers.md),* but the opposite is not true  

They are also called **Counting Numbers**

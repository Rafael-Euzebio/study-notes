# Prime Numbers

- Numbers which the only [Factors](./Eyntam_Factors.md) are 1 and the number itself
    - 2, 3, , 5, 7...
        - No other number can be multiplied together to achieve 2, 3, and 7 other than 1 and the number itself
        $${1}\cdot{2} = 2$$
        $${1}\cdot{3} = 3$$
        $${1}\cdot{5} = 5$$
        $${1}\cdot{7} = 7$$
    - **2 is the only even prime number**

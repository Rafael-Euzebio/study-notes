# Fractions Division
- Turn the second fraction into its [Reciprocal](./Eyntam_Reciprocal.md)
    - Multiply the first fraction by its reciprocal
    $$\frac{3}{5} \div \frac{8}{9}$$
    $$\frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{9}{8}$$
    $$\frac{27}{40}$$

## Why it works
An example of why multiplying by the reciprocal works
    $$10 \div 2 = 5$$ 
    $$\frac{10 \div 2}{1 \div 1} = \frac{5}{1} = 5$$ 
    $$\frac{10 \cdot 1}{1 \cdot 2} = \frac{10}{2} \div 2 = \frac{5}{1} = 5$$

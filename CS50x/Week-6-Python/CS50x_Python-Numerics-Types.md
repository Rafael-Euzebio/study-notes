# Python Numerics Types
There are three numeric data types in Python, these are:

- [Integer](../Week-1-C/CS50x_Integer.md)
- [Floating](../Week-1-C/CS50x_Floating.md)
- [Python Complex Numbers](ST_Python-Complex-Numbers)

In Python 3 an Integer is unbounded, so it has no maximum value  
Floating numbers implemented with *C Doubles*, so their precision depends on the system   
**Booleans are a subtype of Integers**

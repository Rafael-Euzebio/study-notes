# Python Sequences Types
Python has three main *sequence types*
- [Python Lists](./CS50x_Python-Lists.md)
- [Python Ranges](./CS50x_Python-Ranges.md)
- [Python Tuples](./CS50x_Python-Tuples.md)

A *string* is also considered a sequence (of Unicode code), but is described separately of the three main sequences types.

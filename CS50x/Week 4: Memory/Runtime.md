# Runtime
Runtime (run-time, run time, execution time) is the time window of execution of a program, previously compiled.

## Errors
Errors during runtime happens in the middle of the program execution, often resulting in the program to freeze or crash. The causes might be: 
- Unexpected input from user
- Running out of memory
- Trying to opening a file that doesn't exist
etc...

# Derived Data Types
Derived Data Types are data types derived from [[Primitive Data Types]].
They are not exactly "types", instead they add extra functionalities to existing types.

## Derived Data Types in C
- [[Arrays]]
- [[Pointer]]
- [[Functions]]
- [[Unions]]
- [[Structures]]

### Array
An array is a continous list of the same data type. Example, a *string* is a continous list of *chars*.

### Pointers
A pointer is a variable capable to store the address in the memory of another variables.

### Functions 
A function is a contained block of code with one or more statements that can be called from another part of the code. Its type is defined by its return type.

### Unions
Unions are variables with different attributes, very similar to structs. The difference being that unions can only store one attribute at a time.

### Structs
Structs are collections of variables under the same name, they can be described the same way of *unions*, a variable with different attributes. Though structs can hold attributes at the same time.

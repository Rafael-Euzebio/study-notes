# API
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a application publicly avaliable with the intent of sending [HTTP Response](./CS50x_HTTP-Response.md) to anyone who executes [HTTP Request](./CS50x_HTTP-Request.md) on it

Usually the information is sent in [JSON](./CS50x_JSON.md) format

An API allows us to get data from databses that others have created and using on our own applications

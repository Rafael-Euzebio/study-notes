# Linear Time
Linear Time complexity means the [Time Complexity](./CS50x_Time-Complexity.md) of an algorithm grows linearly according to input size.
That means if the input given to an algorithm is 1 (or contains a single item) it will perform a single operation, but if it is 1000 (or contains a thousand items), it will perform 1000 operations.

It is specified as $(n)$
Where $n$ = input size.

Linear time complexity is particularly true with programs that contain a single loop, that must be iterated according to `n` value.

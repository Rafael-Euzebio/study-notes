# Sorting Algorithms
A Sorting Algorithms are [Algorithms](../Week-0_Scratch/CS50x_Algorithms.md) that sorts elements of a list, array or some other type of structure.  

## Advantages
There are different methods for sorting elements and efficiency is considered important to optimize other algorithms.  
Some algorithms, like Binary Search also requires the elements of a list to be sorted.

## Types 
- [Selection Sort](./CS50x_Selection-Sort.md)
- [Bubble Sort](./CS50x_Bubble-Sort.md)
- [Merge Sort](./CS50x_Merge-Sort.md)

# Derived Data Types
Derived Data Types are data types derived from [Primitive Data Types](../Week-1_C/CS50x_Primitive-Data-Types.md).
They are not exactly "types", instead they add extra functionalities to existing types.

## Derived Data Types in C
- [Arrays](./CS50x_Arrays.md)
- [Pointer](../Week-4_Memory/CS50x_Pointer.md)
- [Functions](../Week-1_C/CS50x_Functions.md)
- [Unions](Unions)
- [Structures](../Week-3_Algorithms/CS50x_Structures.md)

### Array
An array is a continous list of the same data type. Example, a *string* is a continous list of *chars*.

### Pointers
A pointer is a variable capable to store the address in the memory of another variables.

### Functions 
A function is a contained block of code with one or more statements that can be called from another part of the code. Its type is defined by its return type.

### Unions
Unions are variables with different attributes, very similar to structs. The difference being that unions can only store one attribute at a time.

### Structs
Structs are collections of variables under the same name, they can be described the same way of *unions*, a variable with different attributes. Though structs can hold attributes at the same time.

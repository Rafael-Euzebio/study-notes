# Final Project
[Problem Set](./CS50x_Problem-Sets.md)

## Ideas
- Terminal Music Player in C
    - Read audio files (mp3, opus, flac, others..) from a folder recursively
    - Allow the user to play one of the files
    - Sort by metadata
        - Album
        - Singer
        - Duration
    - Add file path to playlists (.m3u files)        
        - Play every song from a given playlist

- Browser/Device fingerprinting in HTML, CSS, JS, Flask and SQL
    - Gets user's device and browser information
        - Creates a unique identifier based on that information
    - Identifies user even in incognito mode or under VPN

# Factorial Time
Factorial Time complexity means the [[Time Complexity]] of an algorithm is the factorial of its input.

If the input is of size 3 than the amount of operations is $!3$, aka 6.

$4! = 24$  
$5! = 120$  
$6! = 720$  

Factorial Time Complexity are the worst due to how fast the amount of operations grows, even if the input grew by one.

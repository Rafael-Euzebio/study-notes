# Asymptotic Notation
In mathematics, Asymptotic Notations are used to describe the behavior of a function as its input gets larger.  
In computer science it is used to describe algorithms [[CS50x Time Complexity]] and [[Space Complexity]]

## Notations
Time complexity is described with *mathematical notations*:
- [[CS50x Big O Notation]]
- [[CS50x Big Omega Notation]]
- [[CS50x Big Theta Notation]]

# Asymptotic Notation
In mathematics, Asymptotic Notations are used to describe the behavior of a function as its input gets larger.  
In computer science it is used to describe algorithms [[Time Complexity]] and [[Space Complexity]]

## Notations
Time complexity is described with *mathematical notations*:
- [[Big O Notation]]
- [[Big Omega Notation]]
- [[Big Theta Notation]]

# Search Algorithms
Search Algorithms are [[CS50x Algorithms]] that retrieves information from a data structure.

## Types
The ideal search algorithm to be used depends on how the data is structured, if its sorted or not, etc...

Search algorithms can be classified in 3 types, according to their mechanism:  
- [[CS50x Linear Search]]
- [[CS50x Binary Search]]
- [[Hashing]]

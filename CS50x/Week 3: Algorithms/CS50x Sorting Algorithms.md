# Sorting Algorithms
A Sorting Algorithms are [[CS50x Algorithms]] that sorts elements of a list, array or some other type of structure.  

## Advantages
There are different methods for sorting elements and efficiency is considered important to optimize other algorithms.  
Some algorithms, like Binary Search also requires the elements of a list to be sorted.

## Types 
- [[CS50x Selection Sort]]
- [[CS50x Bubble Sort]]
- [[CS50x Merge Sort]]

# Quadratic Time
Quadratic Time complexity means the [[Time Complexity]] of an algorithm grows quadratically according to input size.
That means 1 operations will be performed for 1 item, 4 for 2 items, 9 for 3 items and so on...

It is specified as $(n^2)$
Where $n$ = input size

Quadratic Time Complexity is particularly true with programs that contain nested loops.

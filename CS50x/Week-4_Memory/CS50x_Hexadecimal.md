# Hexadecimal
Hexadecimal is a numeral system that represents numbers using digits from 0 to 9  and A to F.

## Representation
Numbers are represented from 0 to 9 and A to F, where `A` means `10` and `F` means `15`    
> x<sup>16</sup> y<sup>1</sup>  
where `x` and `y` = 0 ~ F

Hexadecimal allows to represent binary in a shorter way and friendlier way  
e.g: the number 15 can needs 4 digits to be represented in binary:  
`1111`  
While in `hexadecimal` it can be represented with a single `F`  
Adding an additional digit would allow us to represent numbers up to 255  
`FF = 255`

## Use
Hexadecimal is widely used to represent [RGB](../Week-0_Scratch/CS50x_RGB.md) colours and [Memory Address](./CS50x_Memory-Address.md), and *HEX* codes can always be converted to something else through [Character Encoding](../Week-0_Scratch/CS50x_Character-Encoding.md)

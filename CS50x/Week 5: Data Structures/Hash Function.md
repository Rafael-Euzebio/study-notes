# Hash Function
A Hash function is a function that retrieves fixed-size values by computing arbitrary size data  
The values returned by a hash function are called *hash codes*, *hash values*, *digests* or *hashes*

## Hashing 
The proccess of computing a value with a hash function is often called *hashing*. A good hash function should:
1. Be very fast to compute
2. Minimize the duplication of output values (Collision)

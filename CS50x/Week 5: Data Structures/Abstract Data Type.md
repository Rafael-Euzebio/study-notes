# Abstract Data Types
Abstract Data Types (ADTs) are concepts and logical descriptions of *data types* and [[Data Structures]].  

## Abstraction
ADTs are purely a theoretical concept, a description of  
- What a *data type* or *data structure* represents
- What is it's behavior
- What operations are allowed to it

They do not correspond to features of programming languages, and are instead used to visualize the management and behavior of data types and [[Data Structures]] in any language
Hence the "Abstract" in "Abstract Data Type"

### Abstract Stack Example
A [[Stack]] can be described with 3 operations: 
- Push: Adds an element to the stack
- Pop: Removes the most recent element added to the stack
- Peek: Gives the value of the last element added to the stack

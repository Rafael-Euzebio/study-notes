# Full-Disk Encryption
Full-Disk Encryption refers to encrypting the contents of a disk (HDD, SSD, USB-Sticks...) so an attacker cannot read its contents by attaching it as an external drive to another machine. 

The contents can only be decrypted with the [password](./CS50x_Passwords.md) used to encrypt it

# End-to-End Encryption
End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) is the use of [encryption algorithms](../Week-2_Arrays/CS50x_Encryption-Algorithms.md) to encrypt information from one device to another without the use of a middle-man

Essentially it means that only the parties that must know what data is being sent/received can encrypt and decrypt it, the server that manages the connection has no knowledge about the *keys* used to encrypt or even the algorithm itself

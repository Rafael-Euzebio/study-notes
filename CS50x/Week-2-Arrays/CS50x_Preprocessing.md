# Preprocessing
Preprocessing is the first step of compilation in C.
In this step all statements starting with *#* are preprocessed.

## File Inclusion
The pre-processor takes the `#include` statements and searches for its corresponding files in the machine, located under `/usr/include/`, and essentially copy-and-paste that file in your code.

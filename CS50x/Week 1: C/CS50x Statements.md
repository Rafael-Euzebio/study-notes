# Loops
Loops are [[CS50x Statements]] that execute a code block many times, usually specified a number of times, or until a condition is met, or indefinitely

## Types of loop
There are two types of loops, [[CS50x Count-Controlled loops]] and [[CS50x Condition-Controlled loops]]. But they can also be called *for loops* and *while loops*.

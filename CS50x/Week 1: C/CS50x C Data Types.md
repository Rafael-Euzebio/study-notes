# C Data Types
In [[CS50x C]] a data type is an attribute that tells a computer how to interpret a variable's value. 
A data type is limited by a set of allowed operations or representations of the values stored in them. 

## Types of Data Types
Data Types can be classified as follow:

| Type                    | Description                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[CS50x Primitive Data Types]]|The most basic data types, these are can be classified as integer, floating and character data types.                        |
| [[CS50x Derived Data Types]]      |Data types derived from the primitive data types.                                                                            |
| [[CS50x Void]]                    |Something specified as a void type means it has no value, or doesn't take any value as argument, or doesn't return any value.|
| [[CS50x User Defined Data Types]] |Data types defined by the user, mainly names assigned to constants or structures for readability purposes.                   |

# Machine Code
Machine code is a language, usually [[CS50x Binary]], used to directly control a CPU and perform specific tasks

While it is possible for humans to write code directly in machine code, that's not efficient, since source code manipulates and calculates individuals bits and addresses, which if done by a human is tedious and error-prone

Humans instead write [[CS50x Source Code]] which is turned into machine code later by [[CS50x Compiler]].

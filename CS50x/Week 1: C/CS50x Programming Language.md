## High-Level and Low-Level Languages
Programming languages are often defined as a *high-level* or *low-level language*  

A low-level programming language is "closer" to the machine. The operations must be explicitly and literally declared without much ambiguity. It's common to make operations with memory addresses and such  
A low-levle programming language doesn't make as much operations in background as a high-level one does. The programmer has more control of what is actually happening, but also has more responsability to implement functions and avoid bugs.

On the other hand, a high-level programming language allows more ambiguity, the syntax uses more english words, many functions are implemented or easy to implement. The programmer rarely has to deal with memory addresses arithmetics, but at the same time has less control, since the language itself does a lot of background work.

# Primitive Data Type
Primitive Data Types are [[CS50x C Data Types]] that come built in with the C language. Thus all C compilers support these data types.

## Types
C comes with 4 built in data types, these are:
- [[CS50x Integer]]
- [[CS50x Floating]]
- [[CS50x Double]]
- [[CS50x Character]]

Here's a table detailing C primitive data types.

| Type      | Short  | Size (bytes)          |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| Integer   | int    | at least 2, usually 4 |
| Character | char   | 1                     |
| Floating  | float  | 4                     |
| Double    | double | 8                     |

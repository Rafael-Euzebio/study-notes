# IP
IP (Internet Protocol) is a protocol that defines how devices communicate with each other on the Internet. It defines how devices can send and receive data

## IP Addresses
An IP address is a unique identifier given to each device communicating on the internet. It's a set of numbers that uniquely identify each device  
Though devices don't connect directly to each other through their IP addresses, this connection is managed by [[CS50x Local Networks]]


### IPv4
In the version 4 of IP, each device has a unique address on the range of 0 to 4,294,967,296  
It was represented with 4 groups, separated by dots, each group can range from 0 to 255
`192.0.2.235`
`127.0.0.1`

### IPv6
Due to exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, IPv6 was created.  
It has 8 groups of 16 bits. Each group is represented with four hexadecimal digits, from `0000` to `ffff`  
`2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329`  
The total amount of possibilities is approximately 340 trillion trillion trillion

It uses different types of enconding, some of which are compatible with [ASCII](./CS50x_ASCII.md), its purpose is to unify the dififerent types of encodes so anyone can use different symbols, emojis, letters etc on their devices

## Representation
The differential of Unicode is the possibility of representing Emojis, so we will take that as an example.

U+1F600 = ðŸ˜€

As seen in the above image, each device, social media app, website...has its own version of the same emoji, but all different versions are represented by the same code, thus making them all compatible with each other.

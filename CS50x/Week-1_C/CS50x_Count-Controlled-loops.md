# Count-Controlled Loop
A Count-Controlled is a loop statement that is executed a certain number of times, specified in the program.

## For Loop
A `for loop` is the most used way to build a Count-Controlled loop

```c
int main(void){
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
}
```

**Output**
> the above codeblock will print i from 0 to 9;

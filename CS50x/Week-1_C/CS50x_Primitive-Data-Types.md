# Primitive Data Type
Primitive Data Types are [C Data Types](./CS50x_C-Data-Types.md) that come built in with the C language. Thus all C compilers support these data types.

## Types
C comes with 4 built in data types, these are:
- [Integer](./CS50x_Integer.md)
- [Floating](./CS50x_Floating.md)
- [Double](./CS50x_Double.md)
- [Character](./CS50x_Character.md)

Here's a table detailing C primitive data types.

| Type      | Short  | Size (bytes)          |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| Integer   | int    | at least 2, usually 4 |
| Character | char   | 1                     |
| Floating  | float  | 4                     |
| Double    | double | 8                     |

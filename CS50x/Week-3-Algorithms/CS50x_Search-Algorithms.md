## Types
The ideal search algorithm to be used depends on how the data is structured, if its sorted or not, etc...

Search algorithms can be classified in 3 types, according to their mechanism:  
- [Linear Search](./CS50x_Linear-Search.md)
- [Binary Search](./CS50x_Binary-Search.md)
- [Hashing](Hashing)

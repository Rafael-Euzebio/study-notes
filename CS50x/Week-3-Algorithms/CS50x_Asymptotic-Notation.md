# Asymptotic Notation
In mathematics, Asymptotic Notations are used to describe the behavior of a function as its input gets larger.  
In computer science it is used to describe algorithms [Time Complexity](./CS50x_Time-Complexity.md) and [Space_Complexity](Space_Complexity)

## Notations
Time complexity is described with *mathematical notations*:
- [Big O Notation](./CS50x_Big-O-Notation.md)
- [Big Omega Notation](./CS50x_Big-Omega-Notation.md)
- [Big Theta Notation](./CS50x_Big-Theta-Notation.md)

# Logarithm
Logarithm is a mathematical function to discover the exponent $n$ of a number $x$ to the base $b$.

Its essentially the inverse of exponentation, which calculates the result $x$ of a base $b$ to the exponent $n$.

## Concept
In exponentation a base $b$ is raised to the power of an exponent $n$. The result $x$ corresponds to a repeated multiplication of $b$ $n$ times:

$2^4 = 16$  
$2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16$  

In this example:  
$b$ = 2  
$n$ = 4  
$x$ = 16  

But in this example $4$ is also the $logarithm$ of $16$ to the base $2$, represented as:  
$log {_2}16 = 4$  

So logarithm is essentially discovering how many $n$ times we need to multiply the base $b$ to get $x$  

### Simplification
Knowing that:
- Exponentation is multiplication.
- Logarithm is the opposite of exponentation.

That means *logarithms are the opposite of multiplication: division*.

The example presented earlier:  
$log {_2}16 = 4$  
means that we need to divide $(16$ by $2)$ $4$ times until we reach $1$:  
$16 \div 2 = 8$  
$8 \div 2 = 4$  
$4 \div 2 = 2$  
$2 \div 2 = 1$

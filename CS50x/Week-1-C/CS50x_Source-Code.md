# Source Code
Source code is human-readable [Algorithms](../Week-0-Scratch/CS50x_Algorithms.md) written in certain programming languages with the purpose to perform tasks after being compiled by [Compiler](../Week-2-Arrays/CS50x_Compiler.md) into [Machine Code](./CS50x_Machine-Code.md).

## Example
Bellow is a simple source code in C.
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
	printf("Hello, world");
}
```

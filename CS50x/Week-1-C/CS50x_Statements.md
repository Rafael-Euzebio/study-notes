# Loops
Loops are [Statements](./CS50x_Statements.md) that execute a code block many times, usually specified a number of times, or until a condition is met, or indefinitely

## Types of loop
There are two types of loops, [Count Controlled loops](./CS50x_Count-Controlled-loops) and [Condition Controlled loops](./CS50x_Condition-Controlled-loops). But they can also be called *for loops* and *while loops*.

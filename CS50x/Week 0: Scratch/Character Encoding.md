# Character Encoding

Character encoding is the process of assigning numbers to graphical characters. Aka letters, numbers, symbols, emojis, etc...
Computers convert data using encoding tables

## Representation
How the system handles character enconding depends on which enconding system is being used. For sake of simplicity let's take [[ASCII]] as example

### Converting
The device receives the following Binary sequence:
1001000 1001001 100001

And convert them to decimal numbers, which gives the numbers.
72 73 33

and lastly it looks up on a [[ASCII]] table, converting them to the following characters:
HI!

## Examples
Some examples of characters encoding systems are [[ASCII]] and [[Unicode]]

# Algorithms
An Algorithm is a sequence of instructions that must be followed to solve a problem or perform a task.

## Example
Picture the following problem, you have to locate a single name in a phone book. What are the steps required to perform that task?
A few approaches would be:
- Simply read from page one to the next until finding that name, or eventually reaching the last page.

- Search two pages at a time

- Go to the middle of the phone book and ask "is the name i am looking for to the left or right?". Then, repeat this process, cutting the problem in half and half and half.

Each of these approaches have different [[CS50x Time Complexity]]

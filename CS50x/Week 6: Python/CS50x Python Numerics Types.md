# Python Numerics Types
There are three numeric data types in Python, these are:

- [[CS50x Integer]]
- [[CS50x Floating]]
- [[SF Python Complex Numbers]]

In Python 3 an Integer is unbounded, so it has no maximum value  
Floating numbers implemented with *C Doubles*, so their precision depends on the system   
**Booleans are a subtype of Integers**

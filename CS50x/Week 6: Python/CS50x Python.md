# Python
Python is a high-level [[ST Multiparadigm]] [[CS50x Programming Language]]

## Syntax
Python syntax is designed to improved code readability

```py
import cs50

answer = get_string("What's your name? ")
print("hello,", answer)
```

Same code in C for comparison

```c
#include <cs50.h>

string answer = get_string("What's your name? ");
printf("Hello, %s\n", answer);
```

Python allow us to omit *data types*, *format specifiers* and *new line character*

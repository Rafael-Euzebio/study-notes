# README
This repository contain notes taken during my study sessions and courses.  
The files are Markdown (`.md`) files 

The convention used to Name the files is:
- `_` (underscores) to separate "metadata" (In most files this separates the course's names from the filename)
- `-` (hyphens) to separate filenames with multiple words

The files contain links to each other, these links used to be WikiLinks (`[[]]`), but i've changed them to Markdown Links (`[]()`) for better compatibility and because it allows the use of "aliases" without having to change the original file
